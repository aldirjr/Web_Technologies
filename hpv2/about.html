			<h4>Harry Potter passion</h4>
			<p>
				Started in 2002 (I was 13 years old) when my best friend Habner Gerotto encouraged me to read
				the books. The third book was the least to be released (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of
				Azkaban).
				I read the first two books in that same year and watched the 2nd movie (Harry Potter and the
				Chamber of Secrets) in the cinemas with my brother and cousin.
				My brother got the third book on Crhistmas, we read right away. We had to wait a few months
				before the forth book was released, then the fifth, but we were already in love with the saga...
				<br>
				By the time we were waiting for the 6th book, I already knew some English but I was making an
				extra effort to learn more. The reason? In Brazil, the translated version took months to be
				released and I didnt want to wait.
				I wanted to read as soon as possible, so I had to. I had got my first computer in the previous
				year and I also used to chat with a lot of people on the internet, and Harry Potter was such a
				hot topic.
