			<h2 id="About">About</h2><br>
			<p>Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix (released in the United States, India and Pakistan as Harry
				Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone)[6] is a 2001 fantasy film directed by Chris Columbus and distributed by
				Warner Bros. Pictures.[5] It is based on J. K. Rowling's 1997 novel of the same name. The film is the
				first instalment of the Harry Potter film series and was written by Steve Kloves and produced by David
				Heyman. Its story follows Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as he
				discovers that he is a famous wizard and begins his education. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry
				Potter, with Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger.
				<br>Warner Bros. bought the film rights to the book in 1999 for a reported £1 million ($1.65 million in
				1999). Production began in the United Kingdom in 2000, with Chris Columbus being chosen to create the
				film from a short list of directors that included Steven Spielberg and Rob Reiner. Rowling insisted that
				the entire cast be British and Irish, and the film was shot at Leavesden Film Studios and historic
				buildings around the United Kingdom.

			<h2 id="Storyline">Storyline</h2><br>
			<p>"Harry Potter has never played a sport while flying on a broomstick. He's never worn a Cloak of
				Invisibility, befriended a giant, or helped hatch a dragon. All Harry knows is a miserable life
				with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley. Harry's room
				is a tiny Cupboard Under the Stairs, he hasn't had a birthday party in ten years,and his
				birthday present is his uncle's old socks.
				<br>But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger. A letter
				with an invitation to a wonderful place he never dreamed existed. There he finds not only
				friends, aerial sports, and magic around every corner, but a great destiny that's been waiting
				for him... if Harry can survive the encounter."
				<br>"Till now there's been no magic for Harry Potter. He lives with the miserable Dursleys and
				their abominable son, Dudley. Harry's room is a tiny closet beneath the stairs, and he hasn't
				had a birthday party in ten years. Then a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger. A letter
				with an invitation to an incredible place called Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
				There he finds not only friends, flying sports on broomsticks, and magic in everything from
				classes to meals, but a great destiny that's been waiting for him... if Harry can survive the
				encounter."
				<br>"Harry Potter thinks he is an ordinary boy - until he is rescued by a beetle-eyed giant of a
				man, enrols at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, learns to play Quidditch and does
				battle in a deadly duel. The Reason, Harry Potter IS A WIZARD!"
